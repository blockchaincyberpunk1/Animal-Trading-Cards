			<p class="longpara">Arctic wolf is the common name of this mammal though it’s sometimes called a polar or white wolf. Arctic wolves live in Greenland, Alaska, Iceland and Canada. But, these wolves live in caves and not dens like other types of wolves. Their short noses and small ears help to maintain their body heat on the tundra.
				The territory traveled by an Arctic wolf can add up to hundreds of miles. The population of Arctic wolves is about 200,000. They are not considered to be a threatened species and are officially listed as Least Concern. The main reason that Arctic wolves aren’t threatened is they live on the frozen tundra where very few humans travel and where very few other animals can survive.
				One of the largest populations of these wolves is found in northern Alaska.</p>
